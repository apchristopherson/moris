/** \defgroup EclipseSVNCommands SVN Commands in Eclipse

To commit changes to the project, update to the latest version, or synchronize 
with the latest version:

-# Open the Project Explorer.
-# Right click on the project (or on a particular directory or file).
-# Go to Team.
-# Select the desired action (Update, Commit, etc.).

Refer to @ref CommitMessages for a discussion on proper commit 
comments and messages.

@p Update will update files in your local version of the code that you have not 
modified. For example, suppose that you checkout revision #100 and make changes 
to @p file1.cpp, @p file2.cpp and @p file3.cpp. Suppose further that a second 
developer makes changes to @p file3.cpp and @p file4.cpp and commits those 
changes. Should you try to Update, only the changes to @p file4.cpp will be 
updated on your local copy. Then, should you try to commit your modifications, 
you will be a conflict error related to @p file3.cpp and you will be prompted 
to synchronize your version.

@p Synchronize brings up a new perspective in Eclipse which shows any 
differences between the repository and your local copy of the code. Here, you 
can remedy any conflicts that may exist. Afterwards, you may @p Commit your changes.

@section CommitProcedure Before Committing

Before committing your code to the group's repository, make sure that

- Your code compiles properly in serial, parallel and with the debug flag ON and OFF.
- Your test run successfully.
- There are no doxygen warnings related to what you are committing ( for more on running doxygen, see the @ref RunDoxy section).
