/** @defgroup HMR_Main_Class HMR Main Class

The HMR object is the top class of HMR, that contains all mesh information.
The HMR object is created by the user, and can be initialized by either
passing a parameter list, or loading an HDF5 file from a former calculation
step. Once the object is initialized, the user can

- refine the mesh according to a given field and criteria
- create an interface object to MTK
- save the mesh to an exodus file or an <a href="https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/">HDF5</a> file

<b> Mesh Concepts </b>

The HMR object hosts three different mesh types:

- one instance of the @ref HMR_Background_Mesh
- instances of the @ref HMR_BSpline_Mesh, which is a child class of the @ref HMR_Base_Mesh
- instances of the @ref HMR_Lagrange_Mesh, which is a child class of the @ref HMR_Base_Mesh

<b> Refining a Mesh </b>
    
Refinement is performed in two steps. First, a Field and a refinement criterion is passed to the @ref HMR_Refinement_Manager, which flags all ellements that fulfill the chosen criterion. In the second step, a refinement buffer is created, the refinement list is synchronized with the neighborinc procs, and the child elements are generated.
