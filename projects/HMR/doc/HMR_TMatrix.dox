/** @defgroup HMR_TMatrix T-Matrix Calculation Class

The T_Matrix class calculates T-Matrices for elements. T-Matrices have to be calculated element-wise, and are if needed distributed over nodes in a second step. For each Lagrange mesh, an instance to the calculation object has to be created. The object is defined by the Lagrange Mesh it refers to, and the B-Spline mesh it is connected to.

The calculation object creates two different kinds of T-Matrices for each element

- The T-Matrix which transforms the B-Spline DOFs to Lagrange node. It is created by combining a T-Matrix that projects active B-Spline DOFs to element local B-Spline DOFs and a T-Matrix that projects element local B-Spline DOFs to field values at the Lagrange nodes.
- The refinement Matrix which projects Lagrange DOFs from an element onto its children and children of children. This matrix is required for the L2 projection.

It is important to mention that due to performance reasons, T-Matrices throughout the code are stored so that a vector of node values is found by left-multiplying the B-Spline DOFs with the T-Matrix. This convention is transposed to what is usually found in literature.
