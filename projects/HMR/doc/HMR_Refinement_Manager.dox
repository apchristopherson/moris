/** @defgroup HMR_Refinement_Manager Refinement Manager

@todo The Refinement Manager is currently being migrated to the Geometry Engine.
The refinement manager flags elements for refinement and calls the refinement procedure. Refinement is done against a specified Lagrange Mesh object. There are three default flagging procedures are

- refine against an analytical function
- refine against a nodal field
- refine against an element field

The main refinement categories will be

- <b>%Surface %Refinement</b>: The level of an element is coarser that a specified maximum and the element is intersected, meaning that a specified threshold is within the minimum and maximum value of all nodes that are connected to an element. By default, the threshold is zero.
- <b>%Volume %Refinement</b>: The level of an element is coarser that a specified maximum  and the element is inside, meaning that all nodal values of the element are below a specified threshold. By default, the threshold is zero.
- <b>%Element %Field %Refinement</b>: The element is inside, meaning that the element value of the field is below a specified threshold. By default, the threshold is zero
- <b>%Feature %Size</b>:The value of an element is below a specified threshold, while all its neighbors are above that threshold.
