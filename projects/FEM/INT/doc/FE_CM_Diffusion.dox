/** \page FE_CM_Diffusion Thermal Diffusion Constitutive Model

The diffusion model build into MORIS supports both linear diffusion and linear diffusion with phase change using a so-called phase-field model. 
The difference between the two is the constitutive model used. 
Additionally, the diffusion model supports stabilization using the gradient Galerkin least squares (GGLS) method. 
The first sections of this documentation article will discuss the implementation and theoretical background. A short user guide is given at the end.

NOTE: currently, the implementation with phase change only allows for constant values for the thermal conductivity \f$ \kappa \f$

# Governing Equations

To model the temperature field in the phase change material, the general equation for diffusive heat transport was used:

\f[ \dot{H}(T) = \nabla \cdot (\kappa \nabla T) \f]

Here, \f$ \dot{H} = \frac{\partial H}{\partial t} \f$ denotes the rate of change of enthalpy, \f$ \kappa \f$ the thermal conductivity, 
and \f$ \nabla \cdot (\bm{\cdot}) \f$ and \f$ \nabla (\bm{\cdot}) \f$ are the divergence and gradient operators.
The resulting weak form states as follows:

\f[ 
\int_{\Omega} w \dot{H}(T) \ d\Omega + \int_{\Omega} \nabla w \ \kappa \ \nabla T \ d\Omega 
= \int_{\partial \Omega} w (\bm{q} \cdot \bm{n}) \ d\Gamma + \int_{\Omega} w Q \ d\Omega
\f]

where \f$ Q \f$ denotes a volumetric body load, and \f$ \bm{q} \cdot \bm{n} \f$ the heat flux normal to the boundary surface.


# Constitutive Models

There are two constitutive models for thermal diffusion, one for the simple isotropic diffusion (CM_Diffusion_Linear_Isotropic), 
and one for isotropic diffusion with a phase change using a phase-field model (CM_Diffusion_Linear_Isotropic_Phase_Change). 
The only thing that changes for the second one is the computation of the enthalpy and its derivatives. 
Hence, the second CM is implemented as a child class of the first one, where only the methods for computing these derivatives are changed.

## Isotropic Diffusion

The flux is defined as:

\f[ \bm{q} = \kappa \nabla T \f]


The Entropy is defined as:

\f[ H(T) = \int_{T_{ref}}^{T}  \rho c_p   dT \f]

Hence, the change rate can simply be computed as

\f[ \dot{H}(T) = \rho c_p \pfrac{T}{t} \f]

The class this constitutive model is implemented in is CM_Diffusion_Linear_Isotropic corresponding to the enum Constitutive_Type::DIFF_LIN_ISO .

## Isotropic Diffusion with Phase Change

The class containing this CM is CM_Diffusion_Linear_Isotropic_Phase_Change corresponding to the enum Constitutive_Type::DIFF_LIN_ISO_PC .

Rather than treating the solid and the liquid phase as different materials and resolving the material interface between them, 
a phase-state function (PSF) \f$ f(T) \f$ (sometimes also called a phase-field function) is introduced, 
resolving the current phase state of the phase change material (PCM) as a function of the temperature \f$ T \f$. 
The PSF describes the fraction of the material that has transitioned through the phase change by returning a value \f$ 0 \leq f(T) \leq 1 \f$, 
where 0 indicates the material being in its lower phase state, and 1 indicates that the material is in its upper phase state.
The general phase state function is than defined as:

\f[
f(T) = 
\begin{cases}
0 \ \ \ \ \ \ \  for  \ T \leq T_l \\
]0,1[ \ \ \ for \ T_l < T < T_u \\
1 \ \ \ \ \ \ \  for  \ T \geq T_u
\end{cases}
\f]

Here, \f$ T_l \f$ and \f$ T_u \f$ are used to describe the lower and upper temperature boundary of the phase change regime.
The phase state at a point in space \f$ \bm{x} \f$ can then be resolved using the temperature at that point \f$ T = T(\bm{x}) \f$. 
Using this information, the definition of the enthalpy is expanded to:

\f[ H(T) = \int_{T_{ref}}^{T}  \rho \left( c_p + L_H f(T) \right)  dT \f]

As this term's value drastically changes wherever \f$ T_l < T < T_u \f$, a strong non-linearity is introduced into the governing equations.
Differentiating with respect to the temperature using the chain rule, 
the rate of change of the enthalpy \f$ \dot{H} \f$ can then be computed as follows.

\f[ \dot{H}(T) = \rho \left( c_p + L_H \frac{\partial f(T)}{\partial T} \right) \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} \f]

The derivative of the phase-state function \f$ \frac{\partial f(T)}{\partial T} \f$ is needed. Within the phase change temperature range, 
the above term usually dominates the residual equation. 
Hence, the derivative of the phase-state function chosen also has a significant impact on the order of magnitude of the \f$ \dot{H} \f$ term. 


### Phase-State Functions (PSFs)
There are several different PSFs a user can choose from. As both the constitutive model and the stabilization parameter 
need access to the PSFs and their derivatives, they are define in a separate file: fn_FEM_CM_Phase_State_Functions.hpp.
The different derivatives can be computed by passing in the phase change constant \f$ k_{PC} \f$, the melt temperature \f$ T_m \f$, 
an integer indicating which PSF to use, and a pointer to the field interpolator used, 
from which the temperature at the current point \f$ \bm{x} \f$ can be retrieved.

The following PSFs have been implemented (given are the function values for \f$ T_l < T < T_u \f$)
-# linear:				\f$  f(T) = \frac{T - T_l}{T_u - T_l} \f$ , where \f$ T_l = T_m - \frac{k_{PC}}{2} \f$ and \f$ T_u = T_m + \frac{k_{PC}}{2} \f$
-# cubic:				\f$  f(T) = \frac{2T^3 - 3(T_l+T_u)T^2 + 6 T_l T_u T}{(T_l - T_u)^3}  \f$ , where \f$ T_l = T_m - \frac{k_{PC}}{2} \f$ and \f$ T_u = T_m + \frac{k_{PC}}{2} \f$
-# logistic / sigmoid:	\f$  f(T) = \frac{1}{1+exp(-k_{PC}(T-T_m))} \f$


# GGLS - stabilization

The so-called Gradient Galerkin Least Squares (GGLS) stabilization method has been implemented for the thermal diffusion model.
It is used to mitigate instabilities in the form of temperature oscillations. These might be observed if the thermal problem posed leads to 
steep temperature gradients or a coarse mesh is used. This, in turn, can be due to high heat loads or when using the phase 
change model as the effective heat capacity changes drastically at the interface between melting and non-melting PCM.

The GGLS method is a residual based stabilization method that adds numerical dissipation in areas of high temperature gradients 
by introducing an artificial conductivity \f$ \kappa_a \f$. Adopting the formulation from Ilinca's 2002 paper, to obtain the the GGLS-residual, 
the strong form of the gradient of the residual of the governing equation is multiplied with the modified test function \f$ \tilde{w} \f$:

\f[ \tilde{w} = \kappa_a \nabla w  \f]

Note: this is a departure from the original GGLS formulation as proposed by Franca in 1988. Here, the test function is replaced with the 
gradient of the strong form of the residual multiplied with the artificial conductivity. The simplified formulation from above has shown to be 
effective. Hence, it was adopted.

The computation of the artificial conductivity has been also been adapted from [Ilinca 2002] and modified to contain the latent heat 
in the capacitance term as follows:

\f[ 
\begin{split}
	\kappa_a &= \frac{h^2}{6} \bar{\xi} \\
	\bar{\xi} &= \frac{ cosh \left( \sqrt{6 \alpha} \right) + 2 }{ cosh \left( \sqrt{6 \alpha} \right) - 1 } - \frac{1}{\alpha} \\
	\alpha &= \frac{\rho \left( c_p + L_h \frac{\partial f}{\partial T} \right) h^2 }{6 \kappa \Delta t}
\end{split}
\f]

This leads to the following residual term being added to the weak form: 

\f[	
R_{GGLS} = \int_{\Omega} \nabla w \kappa_a  \nabla \left[ \dot{H}(T) - \nabla \cdot (\kappa \nabla T) - \nabla Q  \right] \ d\Omega 
\f]

Note, that the second part of this term contains mixed space time derivatives and 3rd order spatial derivatives in the form of the gradient 
of the divergence of the flux.

### Implementation of Grad-Div-Flux

To compute the gradient of the divergence of the flux, as contained in the GGLS stabilization term, a help matrix is constructed 
and multiplied with the array of third order derivatives of the shape functions as obtained from the field interpolator.
This reads as follows for 3D:

\f[	
\nabla (\nabla \cdot (\kappa \nabla T) ) =

\left[ \begin{array}{lll lll} 
\kappa & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \kappa & 0 & \kappa & 0 & 0 \\
0 & \kappa & 0 & \kappa & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \kappa & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \kappa & 0 & \kappa & 0 & \kappa & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{array} \right] \ 
\bm{B}^{\bm{xxx}}
\f]

and for 2D:

\f[	
\nabla (\nabla \cdot (\kappa \nabla T) ) =

\left[ \begin{array}{lll lll} 
\kappa & 0 & 0 & \kappa \\
0 & \kappa & \kappa & 0 \\
\end{array} \right] \ 
\bm{B}^{\bm{xxx}}
\f]

Note: the implementation of this term has not been adapted to support a temperature dependent thermal conductivity \f$ \kappa(T) \f$, yet.

# IWGs

## Bulk
The IWG for the bulk is implemented in 
IWG_Diffusion_Bulk, corresponding to the enum IWG\_Type::SPATIALDIFF_BULK.

The following bulk integral is evaluated to obtain the residual contribution:

\f[ 
\bm{R}_{Bulk} =  \int_{\Omega} w \dot{H}(T) \ d\Omega 
                   + \int_{\Omega} \nabla w \ \kappa \ \nabla T \ d\Omega 
                   + \int_{\Omega} \nabla w \kappa_a  \nabla \left[ \dot{H}(T) - \nabla \cdot (\kappa \nabla T) - \nabla Q \right] \ d\Omega 
\f]


## Von-Neumann BC
The IWG for the \textsc{Neumann} boundary is implemented in 
IWG_Diffusion_Neumann, corresponding to the enums IWG\_Type::SPATIALDIFF_NEUMANN.

The following boudary integral is evaluated to obtain the residual contribution:

\f[ \bm{R}_{N} = \int_{\Gamma_N} w (\bm{q} \cdot \bm{n}) \ d\Gamma \f]

The IWG can be defined using both CMs, with and without phase change, as it is not dependent on the definition of the enthalpy.

## Dirichlet BC
The IWG for the \textsc{Dirichlet} boundary is implemented in 
IWG_Diffusion_Dirichlet_Nitsche, corresponding to the enums IWG\_Type::SPATIALDIFF_DIRICHLET_SYMMETRIC_NITSCHE 
and IWG\_Type::SPATIALDIFF_DIRICHLET_UNSYMMETRIC_NITSCHE.
The IWG can be defined using both CMs, with and without phase change, as it is not dependent on the definition of the enthalpy.

## Robin BC
To model heat transfer over a boundary due to convection or radiation, a temperature dependent heat flux is imposed.

This has not been implemented, yet.


# Benchmarks/Examples

There are three benchmark problems used to validate and test the diffusion model:

- A Fickian Problem: This simple 1D-bar type problem is used to test the general isotropic diffusion model by comparing numerical and analytical solutions.
- A Stefan's Problem: Adopted from a COMSOL benchmark, this 1D "melting bar" problem is to test validate the phase change constitutive model.
- GGLS Demo-Problem: Adopted from Ilinca's 2002 paper, this 1D-bar problem is used to validated the effect of the GGLS

# User Guide

To set up a problem using the diffusion model, the following keywords are used for parameter input.

In the constitutive models and the stabilization parameter:
- "Conductivity"       -> \f$ \kappa \f$
- "Density"            -> \f$ \rho \f$
- "HeatCapacity"       -> \f$ c_p \f$
- "LatentHeat"         -> \f$ L_H \f$
- "PCTemp"             -> \f$ T_m \f$
- "PhaseStateFunction" -> Integer selecting the PSF to be used according to the above list 
- "PhaseChangeConst"   -> \f$ \Delta T_m \f$ for PSFs 1 and 2, the logistic parameter \f$ k \f$ for PSF 3


In the bulk IWG:
- "Load"      -> Body Load \f$ Q \f$
- "Diffusion" -> Assign either one of the two diffusion constitutive models
- "GGLSParam" -> Assign the stabilization parameter


Tips for running simulations with the phase change model:
- since the enthalpy change rate and gradients can get quiet large in the region of phase transition, it makes sense to scale down the capacitance term (i.e. \f$ \rho \f$, \f$ c_p \f$, and \f$ L_H \f$, and scale up \f$ \kappa \f$, \f$ \bm{q} \f$, and \f$ Q \f$ accordingly)
- the element size in time direction is crucial for stability, if elements "melt" to quickly temperature over- and under-shoots will occur resulting in oscillations in the solution 
- the cubic phase change function has proven to be the "best behaved" one: the linear one results in instabilities for everything except for very small time step sizes, while the logistic one produces much higher gradients
