/** @defgroup FE_Cluster Cluster

The Models will creates a corresponding fem::Cluster, which is a derivative of the msi::Equation_Object, from an mtk::Cluster that is provided by the mtk::Mesh. From the information given by the chopping cells and the element phase, instances of subdividing elements and ghost elements are created.

A Cluster is defined by

- an ID
- an index
- pointers to chopping elements
- pointers to chopping ghost elements
- pointers to the PDOFs of the background element
- ISVs for each chopping element ( "cluster local PDOFs")
- Pointers to surface elements
