# Documentation of Examples

All examples and benchmarks used in moris should be documented in doxygen. The following structure was adapted from the ABAQUS Benchmarks Manual 
(https://classes.engineering.wustl.edu/2009/spring/mase5513/abaqus/docs/v6.6/books/bmk/default.htm?startat=ch01s04.html) 
and should generally be followed: 

-# Problem Description: Brief description of the problem. State what the purpose of this example is (e.g. test specific physics or meshing feature, or the interaction of the two)
-# Problem Setup: All the numbers go here (mesh size, material parameters, etc.)
-# Analytical Solution: If there's an analytic solution to the problem, give it here.
-# Results: If there are any specific results to be expected (e.g. eigenfrequency should always be overestimated compared to analytical solution), this should go here.
-# Literature: If the example is taken from literature as a specific benchmark or as an analytic problem, list the links and citation here. 
-# Developer Notes: Modifications compared to literature, missing features of the example, or observations that should not be forgotten for later, should go here
