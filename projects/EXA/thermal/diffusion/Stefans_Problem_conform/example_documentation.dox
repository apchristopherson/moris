/** \page EXA_THERMAL_STEFANS_PROBLEM Stefan's Problem for Diffusion with Phase Change

# Problem Description
A Stefan's problem is a transient diffusion IBV problem with moving interfaces. A thermal diffusion problem with phase change classifies as such a problem.
The analytical solution to a 1D homogenous thermal diffusion problem consisting of a semi-infinite bar with an initial temperature and a prescribed temparature on one of its sides, is known. 
The Example is adapted from a COMSOL multi-physics benchmark (citation is below).

This Problem is set up to ensure that the numerical results for the thermal diffusion model with phase change match the analytical solution to a satisfiing degree of accuracy. 
Further, this example is split into two parts: one using a conformal mesh, and one using a cut mesh.

# Problem Setup
The domain size for this problem is \f$ \Delta x = 0.28, \ \Delta y = 0.0005 \f$.
The conformal 2D mesh consists of 500x1 elements (\f$ h = 5.6e-4 \f$). The cut mesh uses a background mesh with the same element size and no refinement, i.e. the domain is simply translated 
by a fraction of an element size in \f$ x \f$- and \f$ y \f$- directions on the same background mesh.
The initial temperature is \f$ T_0 = 313 \f$, and a Temperature of \f$ T_{w} = 350 \f$ is imposed on one ends of the bar. All other boundaries are adiabatic.
For the example a timeframe of \f$ t_{max} = 480 \f$, split up into \f$ 10 \f$ time slabs, is used.

The following material parameters are used:
- Density: \f$ \rho = 0.75 \f$
- Heat Capacity: \f$ c_p = 2.4 \f$
- Conductivity: \f$ \kappa = 2.1 \cdot 10^{-7} \f$
- Latent Heat: \f$ L_H = 175.0 \f$
- Melt Temperature: \f$ T_m = 314.5 \f$
- Melting Range: \f$ \Delta T_m = 3.0 \f$

Both Ghost and GGLS stabilization are applied to the problem.

# Analytical Solution
The described Stefan's problem has a analytical solution involving the error function which is defined as:

\f[
erf(z) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_{s=0}^z e^{-s^2} ds
\f]

The thermal diffusivity is defined as

\f[
\alpha = \frac{\kappa}{\rho c_p}
\f]

and the dimensionless distance as

\f[
\eta(x,t) = \frac{x}{2 \sqrt{\alpha t}}
\f]

To obtain the solution at a point \f$ x \f$ (measured from the finite end of the bar) and a time \f$ t \f$, given the initial temperature \f$ T_0 \f$ and the imposed 
wall temperature \f$ T_w \f$, the following solution process can be used.
First, compute the Stefan's number which is defined as 

\f[
Ste = \frac{c_p}{L_H}(T_w - T_m)
\f]

Next, solve the following expression for \f$ \beta \f$ (needs to be done numerically, hence "semi-analytical" solution):

\f[
\beta e^{\beta^2} \cdot \int_{s=0}^{\beta} e^{-s^2} \ ds = \frac{Ste}{2}
\f]

Using the solution for \f$ \beta \f$, the temperature at a given point, can be computed using:

\f[
T(x,t) = T_w + (T_m - T_w) \ \frac{erf(\eta(x,t))}{erf(\beta(Ste)}
\f]

A matlab script for computing the solution is included in git.

# Literature

# Developer Notes
Since imposing the Dirichlet BC from the first timestep onwards leads to instabilities, it is ramped up over the first six time steps. 
As the number of timesteps is so small, the results of the example as run here, are only of limited meaning.
The Comsol benchmark uses a time frame of 57600 with a time step size of \f$ \< 350 \f$.
The material parameters used are scaled, but not changed.
