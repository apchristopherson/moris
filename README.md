Multi-physics Optimization Research and Innovation System (2022)

MORIS is a research code developed at the University of Colorado in the Aerospace Mechanics Research Center (AMRec)* by Kurt Maute's research group. AMRec was started in the 1990's under the name "Center for Aerospace Structures". It is housed in the Ann and H.J. Smead Department of Aerospace Engineering Sciences.

This code provides a reseach platform for PDE constrained optimization with focus on shape and toplogy optimization using an isogemetric formulation of the extended finite element method.

Installation: see install instructions in share/install. For workstations: Install.md. For linux clusters and gcc: Install_Cluster_gcc.md. For linux clusters and intel compilers: Install_Cluster_intel.md.
