Multi-physics Optimization Research and Innovation System

MORIS is a research code developed at the University of Colorado in the Aerospace Mechanics Research Center (AMRec)* by Prof. Kurt Maute's research group. 

This code provides a reseach platform for PDE constrained optimization with focus on shape and toplogy optimization using an isogemetric formulation of the extended finite element method.


* AMRec was started in the 1990's under the name "Center for Aerospace Structures". It is housed in the Ann and H.J. Smead Department of Aerospace Engineering Sciences.
