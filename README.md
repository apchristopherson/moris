# MORIS

Multi-physics Optimization Research and Innovation System (2022)

## Overview

MORIS is a research code developed at the University of Colorado in the Aerospace Mechanics Research Center (AMRec)* by Kurt Maute's research group. AMRec was started in the 1990's under the name "Center for Aerospace Structures". It is housed in the Ann and H.J. Smead Department of Aerospace Engineering Sciences.

This code provides a research platform for PDE constrained optimization with focus on shape and topology optimization using an isogeometric formulation of the extended finite element method.

## Documentation

### Installation 
All install instructions can be found in [share/install](https://github.com/kkmaute/moris/tree/main/share/install). For workstations: Install.md. For linux clusters and gcc: Install_Cluster_gcc.md. For linux clusters and intel compilers: Install_Cluster_intel.md.

### Mesh Generation
Documentation for generating and outputting meshes can be found [here](https://github.com/kkmaute/moris/blob/main/share/doc/mesh_generation/main.pdf). GitHub's integrated PDF viewer doesn't support links, so please download the pdf to use them. Example input files can be found in [share/doc/mesh_generation/examples](https://github.com/kkmaute/moris/tree/main/share/doc/mesh_generation/examples).
